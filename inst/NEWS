Changes in version: JMbayes_0.5-2

  * Updates for estimating the weight function.

---------------------------------------

Changes in version: JMbayes_0.5-1

  * A shiny web application has been added in the demo folder.

---------------------------------------

Changes in version: JMbayes_0.5-0

  * The MCMC is now implemented with efficient custom-made code and no longer relies on JAGS, WinBUGS or OpenBUGS.

  * The user can specify her own density function for the longitudinal outcome (default is the normal). Among others, 
    this allows fitting joint models with categorical or left-censored longitudinal responses.

  * The baseline hazard is now only estimated with B-splines (regression or penalized).

  * The user has now the option to define custom transformation functions for the longitudinal model terms that
    enter into the linear predictor of the survival submodel.

  * survfitJM.JMbayes() is faster.

  * Backward-incompatible version; the aforementioned changes require refitting joint models that have been fitted
    with previous versions.

---------------------------------------

Changes in version: JMbayes_0.4-1

  * new versions of functions ins() and ibs() with updated 'weight.fun' argument, and makepredictcall() methods.

  * methods have been added for the fitted() and residuals() generics to calculate fitted values and residuals, 
    respectively.

  * a method has been added for the xtable() generic from package xtable for producing a LaTeX table with the
    results of the joint model.

---------------------------------------

Changes in version: JMbayes_0.4-0

  * the new function bma.combine() combines predictions using Bayesian model averaging.

  * logLik.JMbayes() can now calculate marginal log-likelihoods averaging over the random effects and the parameters.

  * the new function marglogLik() calculates marginal likelihood contributions for individual subjects.

  * the new generic function aucJM() calculates time-dependent AUCs for joint models.

  * the new generic function dynCJM() calculates a dynamic discrimination index 
    (weighted average of time-dependent AUCs) for joint models.

  * the new generic function prederrJM() calculates prediction errors for joint models.

  * jointModelBayes() can now fit robust joint models in which both the error terms for the longitudinal outcome
    and the random effects are assumed to follow a Student's t distribution. This is controlled by the arguments
    'robust' and 'df' for the error terms, and 'robust.b' and 'df.b' for the random effects.

---------------------------------------

Changes in version: JMbayes_0.2-0

  * the new control argument 'ordSpline' sets the order of the spline for the B-spline basis (i.e.,
    it is passed to the 'ord' argument of splineDesign()). By setting to 1 a piecewise-constant baseline
    hazard is fitted.

  * corrected some typos in .Rd files.

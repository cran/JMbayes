Changes in version: JMbayes_0.2-0

  * the new control argument 'ordSpline' sets the order of the spline for the B-spline basis (i.e.,
    it is passed to the 'ord' argument of splineDesign()). By setting to 1 a piecewise-constant baseline
    hazard is fitted.

  * corrected some typos in .Rd files.
